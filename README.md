# MAKING AN NFT COLLECTION
# Project Description 
My goal is to write code that will help me launch an NFT collection of 10,000 images. I will be designing all the art/layers for the project and hopefully releasing it once it's done.
# Software
I will be coding using Javascript to create the final images for the collection. I may or may not also need to learn some Solidity which is the language used to code smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
# Current Progress
Currently, I'm working on creating the art layers and brainstorming about possible traits. Also will be making a walkthrough video soon.
# Artist/Creator
Jacob Grimm
