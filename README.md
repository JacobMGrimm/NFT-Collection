# MAKING AN NFT COLLECTION
# Project Description 
My goal is to write code that will help me launch an NFT collection of various auto generated images/artworks. I will be designing all the art/layers for the project and hopefully releasing it once it's done.
# Software
I coded using Javascript to create the final images for the collection.
# Current Progress
I'm finished with the project and decided on a final number of 100 images.
# Artist/Creator
Jacob Grimm
